The goal is to make the code testable, not to add features or fix bugs.\n\n### Recommended Extraction Order\n\n1. **Extract message type handlers first**\n   Each `case someMsg:` in Update() becomes:\n   ```go\n   func (m Model) handleSomeMsg(msg someMsg) (Model, tea.Cmd) {\n       // Move existing code here unchanged\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Then extract key handlers per view**\n   ```go\n   func (m Model) handleListKeys(msg tea.KeyMsg) (Model, tea.Cmd)\n   func (m Model) handleBoardKeys(msg tea.KeyMsg) (Model, tea.Cmd)\n   func (m Model) handleGraphKeys(msg tea.KeyMsg) (Model, tea.Cmd)\n   ```\n\n3. **Finally extract render helpers**\n   ```go\n   func (m Model) renderListView() string\n   func (m Model) renderBoardView() string\n   func (m Model) renderDetailView() string\n   ```\n\n### Golden Rule\nAfter each extraction:\n1. Run `go build ./...` - must compile\n2. Run `go test ./pkg/ui/...` - existing tests must pass\n3. Commit the extraction\n\n### Test Writing Strategy\nFor each extracted function, write tests that:\n1. Set up initial Model state\n2. Call the extracted function\n3. Assert on returned Model state and tea.Cmd\n\nExample:\n```go\nfunc TestModel_handleEnterKey(t *testing.T) {\n    m := NewModel(testIssues, nil, \"\")\n    m.viewMode = ViewList\n    \n    newM, cmd := m.handleEnterKey(tea.KeyMsg{Type: tea.KeyEnter})\n    \n    if newM.viewMode != ViewDetail {\n        t.Errorf(\"expected ViewDetail, got %v\", newM.viewMode)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### File Organization\nConsider creating:\n- pkg/ui/handlers.go - All key/message handlers\n- pkg/ui/handlers_test.go - Tests for handlers\n- pkg/ui/render.go - All render functions\n- pkg/ui/render_test.go - Tests for renders","created_at":"2025-11-30T15:40:41Z"}]}

Currently this requires remembering multiple flags.
