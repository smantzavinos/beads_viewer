## 📖 The Core Experience

At its heart, `bv` is about **viewing your work nicely**.

### ⚡ Fast, Fluid Browsing
No web page loads, no heavy clients. `bv` starts instantly and lets you fly through your issue backlog using standard Vim keys (`j`/`k`).
*   **Split-View Dashboard:** On wider screens, see your list on the left and full details on the right.
*   **Markdown Rendering:** Issue descriptions, comments, and notes are beautifully rendered with syntax highlighting, headers, and lists.
*   **Instant Filtering:** Zero-latency filtering. Press `o` for Open, `c` for Closed, or `r` for Ready (unblocked) tasks.

### 🔎 Rich Context
Don't just read the title. `bv` gives you the full picture:
*   **Comments & History:** Scroll through the full conversation history of any task.
*   **Metadata:** Instantly see Assignees, Labels, Priority badges, and creation dates.
*   **Search:** Powerful fuzzy search (`/`) finds issues by ID, title, or content instantly.

### 🎯 Focused Workflows
*   **Kanban Board:** Press `b` to switch to a columnar view (Open, In Progress, Blocked, Closed) to visualize flow.
*   **Visual Graph:** Press `g` to explore the dependency tree visually.
*   **Insights:** Press `i` to see graph metrics and bottlenecks.
*   **Ultra-Wide Mode:** On large monitors, the list expands to show extra columns like sparklines and label tags.

## 📐 Architecture & Design

`bv` treats your project as a **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**, not just a list. This allows it to derive insights about what is *truly* important.

        D[PageRank & Metrics]:::logic
    end

    subgraph "TUI Layer"

    end

    A --> B
    B --> C
    C --> D
    D --> E
    E --> F
    E --> G
    E --> H
```

### Key Metrics
*   **PageRank:** Identifies "foundational" tasks that many others depend on.
*   **Betweenness Centrality:** Highlights "bottleneck" tasks that bridge different parts of the system.
*   **Critical Path:** Calculates the longest path of dependencies to find tasks that directly impact delivery time.

### 1. PageRank (Dependency Authority)
**The Math:** Originally designed to rank web pages by "importance" based on incoming links, PageRank models a "random surfer" walking the graph. In our dependency graph ($u \rightarrow v$ implies $u$ depends on $v$), we treat dependencies as "votes" of importance.
$$
PR(v) = \frac{1-d}{N} + d \sum_{u \in M(v)} \frac{PR(u)}{L(u)}
$$

**Pragmatic Meaning:** **Foundational Blocks.** High PageRank tasks are the bedrock of your project. They are rarely "features" in the user-facing sense; they are often schemas, core libraries, or architectural decisions. Breaking them breaks the graph.

### 2. Betweenness Centrality (Bottlenecks)
**The Math:** Defined as the fraction of all shortest paths in the network that pass through a given node $v$.
$$C_B(v) = \sum_{s \neq v \neq t} \frac{\sigma_{st}(v)}{\sigma_{st}}$$

**Pragmatic Meaning:** **Gatekeepers & Bottlenecks.** A task with high Betweenness is a choke point. It might be an API contract that both the mobile app and the server team are waiting on.

### 3. HITS (Hubs & Authorities)
**The Intuition:** This models a "mutually reinforcing" relationship. Good libraries (Authorities) are used by many applications. Good applications (Hubs) use many good libraries.

**Pragmatic Meaning:** **Epics vs. Infrastructure.**
*   **High Hub Score:** These are your **Epics** or **Product Features**. They aggregate many dependencies to deliver value.
*   **High Authority Score:** These are your **Utilities**. They provide value to many consumers.

### 4. Critical Path (Longest Path in DAG)
**The Math:** In a DAG, the longest path represents the minimum time required to complete the project (assuming infinite parallelism). `bv` computes this recursively:
$$Impact(u) = 1 + \max(\{Impact(v) \mid u \rightarrow v\})$$

**Pragmatic Meaning:** **Keystones.** A Keystone task is one where *any* delay translates 1:1 into a delay for the final project delivery. These tasks have zero "slack."

## 🤖 The Robot Protocol (AI Interface)

`bv` bridges the gap between raw data and AI agents. Agents struggle with graph algorithms; `bv` solves this by acting as a deterministic "sidecar" that offloads the cognitive burden of graph traversal.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    %% Pastel Theme
    participant User
    participant Agent as AI Agent
    participant BV as bv (Sidecar)
    participant File as beads.jsonl

    User->>Agent: "Fix the next blocked task"
    
    rect rgb(240, 248, 255)
        Note over Agent, BV: Cognitive Offloading
        Agent->>BV: exec `bv --robot-plan`
        BV->>File: Read & Parse
        BV->>BV: Compute Topo Sort & Critical Path
        BV-->>Agent: JSON: { "next_actionable": "TASK-123", "reason": "Unblocks 5 items" }
    end
    
    Agent->>Agent: Implement Fix for TASK-123
```

### The "Cognitive Offloading" Strategy
The primary design goal of the Robot Protocol is **Cognitive Offloading**.
Large Language Models (LLMs) are probabilistic engines; they are excellent at semantic reasoning (coding, writing) but notoriously unreliable at algorithmic graph traversal (finding cycles, computing shortest paths).

If you feed an Agent raw `beads.jsonl` data, you are forcing the Agent to:
1.  Parse thousands of lines of JSON.
2.  Reconstruct the dependency graph in its context window.
3.  "Hallucinate" a path traversal or cycle check.

`bv` solves this by providing a deterministic graph engine sidecar.

### Agent Usage Patterns
Agents typically use `bv` in three phases:

1.  **Triage & Orientation:**
    Before starting a session, the agent runs `bv --robot-insights`. It receives a lightweight JSON summary of the project's structural health. It immediately knows:
    *   "I should not work on Task C yet because it depends on Task B, which is a Bottleneck."
    *   "The graph has a cycle (A->B->A); I must fix this structural error before adding new features."

2.  **Impact Analysis:**
    When asked to "refactor the login module," the agent checks the **PageRank** and **Impact Scores** of the relevant beads. If the scores are high, the agent knows this is a high-risk change with many downstream dependents, prompting it to run more comprehensive tests.

3.  **Execution Planning:**
    Instead of guessing the order of operations, the agent uses `bv`'s topological sort to generate a strictly linearized plan.

**JSON Output Schema:**
The output is designed to be strictly typed and easily parseable by tools like `jq` or standard JSON libraries.
```json
{
  "bottlenecks": [
    { "id": "CORE-123", "value": 0.45, "desc": "High Betweenness" }
  ],
  "keystones": [
    { "id": "API-001", "value": 12.0, "desc": "High Impact Depth" }
  ],
  "cycles": [
    ["TASK-A", "TASK-B", "TASK-A"]
  ],
  "density": 0.045
}
```

## 🎨 TUI Engineering & Craftsmanship

`bv` is built with the **Bubble Tea** framework, ensuring a glitch-free, 60fps experience. It features an adaptive layout engine that responds to terminal resize events and a custom ASCII/Unicode graph renderer.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    %% Pastel Theme
    classDef model fill:#fff9c4,stroke:#ffe082,color:#fbc02d
    classDef view fill:#f3e5f5,stroke:#ce93d8,color:#7b1fa2
    classDef logic fill:#e0f2f1,stroke:#80cbc4,color:#00695c

    class Model:::model {
        +[]Issue issues
        +GraphStats analysis
        +Update(msg)
        +View()
    }

    class LayoutEngine:::view {
        +CalculateGeometry(width, height)
        +RenderSplitView()
        +RenderMobileView()
    }

    class GraphEngine:::logic {
        +ComputePageRank()
        +DetectCycles()
        +TopologicalSort()
    }

    Model --> LayoutEngine : uses
    Model --> GraphEngine : uses
```

### 1. Adaptive Layout Engine
`bv` doesn't just dump text; it calculates geometry on every render cycle.
*   **Dynamic Resizing:** The `View()` function inspects the current terminal width (`msg.Width`) on every frame.
*   **Breakpoint Logic:**
    *   `< 100 cols`: **Mobile Mode**. List takes 100% width.
    *   `> 100 cols`: **Split Mode**. List takes 40%, Details take 60%.
    *   `> 140 cols`: **Ultra-Wide**. List injects extra columns (Sparklines, Labels) that are normally hidden.
*   **Padding Awareness:** The layout engine explicitly accounts for borders (2 chars) and padding (2 chars) to prevent "off-by-one" wrapping errors that plague many TUIs.

### 2. Zero-Latency Virtualization
Rendering 10,000 issues would choke a naive terminal app. `bv` implements **Viewport Virtualization**:
*   **Windowing:** We only render the slice of rows currently visible in the terminal window.
*   **Pre-Computation:** Graph metrics (PageRank, etc.) are computed *once* at startup in a separate goroutine, not on every frame.
*   **Detail Caching:** The Markdown renderer is instantiated lazily and reused, avoiding expensive regex recompilation.

### 3. Visual Graph Engine (`pkg/ui/graph.go`)
We built a custom 2D ASCII/Unicode rendering engine from scratch to visualize the dependency graph.
*   **Canvas Abstraction:** A 2D grid of `rune` cells and `style` pointers allows us to draw "pixels" in the terminal.
*   **Manhattan Routing:** Edges are drawn using orthogonal lines with proper Unicode corner characters ( `╭`, `─`, `╮`, `│`, `╰`, `╯`) to minimize visual noise.
*   **Topological Layering:** Nodes are arranged in layers based on their "Impact Depth," ensuring that dependencies always flow downwards.

---

## 📈 Visual Data Encoding: Sparklines & Heatmaps

In dense information environments like the terminal, text is expensive. `bv` employs high-density data visualization techniques (`pkg/ui/visuals.go`) inspired by Edward Tufte to convey complex metrics in minimal space.

### 1. Unicode Sparklines
When viewing the list in Ultra-Wide mode, `bv` renders a "Graph Score" column using Unicode block characters (` `, `▂`, `▃`, `▄`, `▅`, `▆`, `▇`, `█`).
*   **The Math:** `RenderSparkline(val, width)` normalizes a float value (0.0 - 1.0) against the available character width. It calculates the precise block height for each character cell to create a continuous bar chart effect.
*   **The Utility:** This allows you to scan a list of 50 issues and instantly spot the "spikes" in complexity or centrality without reading a single number.

### 2. Semantic Heatmaps
We don't just use random colors. `pkg/ui/visuals.go` implements a perceptually uniform color ramp (`GetHeatmapColor`) that maps metric intensity to a gradient:
*   `0.0 - 0.2`: **Low** (Gray/Dim)
*   `0.2 - 0.5`: **Mid** (Blue/Cool)
*   `0.5 - 0.8`: **High** (Purple/Warm)
*   `0.8 - 1.0`: **Peak** (Pink/Hot)
This visual encoding is applied to badges in the Insights Dashboard, allowing you to differentiate between "somewhat important" and "critically urgent" tasks at a glance.

## 🔍 Search Architecture

In a project with thousands of issues, you cannot afford to wait for a backend query. `bv` implements a **composite, in-memory fuzzy search** that feels instantaneous.

### The "Flattened Vector" Index
Instead of searching fields individually (which requires complex UI controls), `bv` flattens every issue into a single searchable "vector" at load time.
The `FilterValue()` method constructs a composite string containing:
*   **Core Identity:** ID (`"CORE-123"`) and Title (`"Fix login race condition"`)
*   **Metadata:** Status (`"open"`), Type (`"bug"`), Priority
*   **Context:** Assignee (`"@steve"`) and Labels (`"frontend, v1.0"`)

### Fuzzy Subsequence Matching
When you press `/`, the search engine performs a **fuzzy subsequence match** against this composite vector.
*   **Example:** Typing `"log fix"` successfully matches `"Fix login race condition"`.
*   **Example:** Typing `"steve bug"` finds bugs assigned to Steve.
*   **Example:** Typing `"open v1.0"` filters for open items in the v1.0 release.

---

## 📄 The Status Report Engine

`bv` isn't just for personal browsing; it's a communication tool. The `--export-md` flag generates a **Management-Ready Status Report** that converts your repo state into a polished document suitable for stakeholders.

### 1. The "Hybrid Document" Architecture
The exporter (`pkg/export/markdown.go`) constructs a document that bridges human readability and visual data:
*   **Summary at a Glance:** Top-level statistics (Total, Open, Blocked, Closed) give immediate health context.
*   **Embedded Graph:** It injects the full dependency graph as a Mermaid diagram *right into the document*. On platforms like GitHub or GitLab, this renders as an interactive chart.
*   **Anchor Navigation:** A generated Table of Contents uses URL-friendly slugs (`#core-123-refactor-login`) to link directly to specific issue details, allowing readers to jump between the high-level graph and low-level specs.

### 2. Semantic Formatting
We don't just dump JSON values. The exporter applies specific formatting rules to ensure the report looks professional:
*   **Metadata Tables:** Key fields (Assignee, Priority, Status) are aligned in GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown) tables with emoji indicators.
*   **Conversation threading:** Comments are rendered as blockquotes (`>`) with relative timestamps, preserving the flow of discussion distinct from the technical spec.
*   **Intelligent Sorting:** The report doesn't list issues ID-sequentially. It applies the same priority logic as the TUI: **Open Critical** issues appear first, ensuring the reader focuses on what matters now.

---

## 🧪 Quality Assurance & Robustness

Trust is earned. `bv` employs a rigorous testing strategy to ensure it can handle the messy reality of real-world repositories.

### 1. Synthetic Data Fuzzing
We don't just test on "happy path" data. The test suite (`pkg/loader/synthetic_test.go`) generates **Synthetic Complex Graphs**—large JSONL files with thousands of nodes, intricate dependency cycles, and edge-case UTF-8 characters—to verify that the graph engine and rendering logic never panic under load.

### 2. Robustness Against Corruption
In a git-based workflow, merge conflicts and partial writes happen. The `TestLoadIssuesRobustness` suite explicitly injects garbage lines and corrupted JSON into the data stream.
*   **Result:** `bv` detects corruption, logs a warning to `stderr`, and continues loading the valid data. It never crashes the user session due to a single bad line.

---

## 🔄 The Zero-Friction Update Engine

`bv` includes a proactive, non-intrusive update check to ensure you never miss a feature. We believe tools should maintain themselves without interrupting your flow.

### Design & Implementation
The updater (`pkg/updater/updater.go`) is architected for silence and safety:
1.  **Non-Blocking Concurrency:** The check runs in a detached goroutine with a strict **2-second timeout**. It never delays your startup time or UI interactivity.
2.  **Semantic Versioning:** It doesn't just match strings. A custom SemVer comparator ensures you are only notified about strictly *newer* releases, handling complex edge cases like release candidates vs. stable builds.
3.  **Resilience:** It gracefully handles network partitions, GitHub API rate limits (403/429), and timeouts by silently failing. You will never see a crash or error log due to an update check.
4.  **Unobtrusive Notification:** When an update is found, `bv` doesn't pop a modal. It simply renders a subtle **Update Available** indicator (`⭐`) in the footer, letting you choose when to upgrade.

---

## 🗂️ Data Loading & Self-Healing

Reliability is key. `bv` doesn't assume a perfect environment; it actively handles common file system inconsistencies.

### 1. Intelligent Path Discovery
The loader (`pkg/loader/loader.go`) doesn't just blindly open `.beads/beads.jsonl`. It employs a priority-based discovery algorithm:
1.  **Canonical:** Checks for `beads.jsonl`.
2.  **Legacy:** Fallback to `issues.jsonl` for older repos.
3.  **Base:** Checks `beads.base.jsonl` (used by `bd` in daemon mode).
4.  **Validation:** It skips temporary files like `*.backup` or `deletions.jsonl` to prevent displaying corrupted state.

### 2. Robust Parsing
The JSONL parser is designed to be **Lossy-Tolerant**.
*   It uses a buffered scanner (`bufio.NewScanner`) with a generous 10MB line limit to handle massive description blobs.
*   Malformed lines (e.g., from a merge conflict) are skipped with a warning rather than crashing the application, ensuring you can still view the readable parts of your project even during a bad git merge.

## 🧩 Design Philosophy: Why Graphs?

Traditional issue trackers (Jira, GitHub Issues, Trello) model work as **Buckets**: "To Do", "In Progress", "Done". This is fine for simple task lists, but it fails at scale because it ignores **Structure**.

In complex software projects, tasks are not isolated. They are deeply interconnected. A "simple" frontend task might depend on a backend endpoint, which depends on a schema change, which depends on a migration script.

`bv` adopts a **Graph-First** philosophy:
1.  **Structure is Reality:** The dependency graph *is* the project. The list view is just a projection of that graph.
2.  **Explicit Blocking:** We don't just "relate" tasks; we define strict "blocks". If A blocks B, you literally cannot mark B as "Ready" in `bv` until A is Closed.
3.  **Local-First, Text-Based:** Your project data lives in your repo (`.beads/beads.jsonl`), not on a remote server. It travels with your code, branches with your git, and merges with your PRs.

---

## ⚡ Performance Specs

`bv` is engineered for speed. We believe that latency is the enemy of flow.

*   **Startup Time:** < 50ms for typical repos (< 1000 issues).
*   **Rendering:** 60 FPS UI updates using [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea).
*   **Virtualization:** List views and Markdown renderers are fully windowed. `bv` can handle repositories with **10,000+ issues** without UI lag, consuming minimal RAM.
*   **Graph Compute:** The analysis engine runs in a separate goroutine, pre-calculating metrics for thousands of nodes in sub-second time on standard hardware.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: My icons look weird / text is misaligned.**
*   `bv` requires a terminal with **TrueColor** support and a **Nerd Font** installed.
*   *Recommended:* [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) (e.g., "JetBrains Mono Nerd Font" or "Hack Nerd Font").
*   *Terminals:* Windows Terminal, iTerm2, Alacritty, Kitty, WezTerm.

**Q: I see "Cycles Detected" in the dashboard. What now?**
A: A cycle (e.g., A → B → A) means your project logic is broken; no task can be finished first. Use the Insights Dashboard (`i`) to find the specific cycle members, then use `bd` to remove one of the dependency links (e.g., `bd unblock A --from B`).

**Q: Does this work with Jira/GitHub?**
A: `bv` is data-agnostic. The Beads data schema supports an `external_ref` field. If you populate your `.beads/beads.jsonl` file with issues from external trackers (e.g., using a custom script or sync tool), `bv` will render them alongside your local tasks. Future versions of the `bd` CLI may support native syncing, but `bv` is ready for that data today.
